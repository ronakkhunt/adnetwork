					<dt>Why are some ads displayed more often by MyMedia.com Publishers than others?</dt>
					<dd>BreezAds.com displays the ads of the Advertisers that pay highest bid. This way we assure bidders that they pay only for quality websites they want and at the same time this model is evolutionarily the best one for Publishers who put efforts into developing their websites to get the most profit with MyMedia.com monetizing methods. The longer you use MyMedia.com, the better your earnings will be over time. </dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>How many sites I can publish my MyMedia.com advertising on? </dt>
					<dd>You can publish MyMedia.com advertising on as many websites as you wish if they are compatible with our TOS. Our Smart Algorithms will detect proper content on the website and update it to correct the advertising published. You can use the very same ads HTML code on as many websites as you like or create separate if you are interested in tracking separate campaigns - it is all up to you.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>What is the maximum number of ads that can be displayed per page?</dt>
					<dd>We limited it to 3 ads blocks per page since our algorithms are optimized and convert best at that number.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>May I use more advertising than just MyMedia.com?</dt>
					<dd>Sure you can use other publishing programs if they accept multiple websites. Of course be aware that monetizing and profits will become lower if you put too many ads on a page. Your visitors may not feel comfortable and quit faster. That is why we limit our ad blocks / displays to 3 per page.</dd>
				</dl>
				<dl>
					<dt>How do I get in touch if I have more questions?</dt>
					<dd>We are available 24/7 on the email / chat support at the contact page. We welcome you to get in touch at any time with questions, problems or suggestions.</dd>
